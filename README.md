# PizzeriaProject - A Web-based online pizza ordering system using Java EE - IT- Programmer-Analyst program at NBCC - Class of 2020

This system will allow customers to order pizzas online for pickup or home delivery.

# Business Case:
Pizza restaurants are a multi-billion dollar industry and they are literally across the globe. As the number of internet users are increasing, many companies are introducing Online Pizza Ordering Systems for taking orders from customers. These systems not only improve customer experience but also ease the workload on restaurant staff.
Ordering a pizza by phone seems easy to do but sometimes there is miscommunication. Since there is no visual menu shown during the phone call, restaurant employees have to repeat many things again and again to customers. This is a time consuming process that can irritate customers and take a lot of time for restaurant staff.
It would be much more comfortable for customers to order their pizza online. It would be hassle free for users as they can select the pizza and toppings they want and make payment for it.
In summary, online pizza ordering will improve the service provided to the restaurant’s customers. From a business point of view, it gives you an edge over competitors.
